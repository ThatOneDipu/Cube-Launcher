//! A "log viewer" made with iced widgets.
//!
//! This is honestly complete and utter garbage.
//! I barely knew what I was doing when I made this,
//! and better solutions definitely might exist.
//!
//! It supports:
//! - Basic "word-wrapping" (cuts off words sometimes)
//! - Rough, per-line scrolling (because `iced::widget::scrollable`
//!   is magic I can't replicate).
//! - Click to copy a line to clipboard.
//!
//! `iced::widget::scrollable` renders the whole damn thing, not slices,
//! so I can't use it. I can't figure out how to make this as smooth as
//! `scrollable`.
//!
//! **NOTE: You have to handroll your own scrollbar**.
//! It's pretty simple through, the integration/hooks are already there,
//! you just need to place the final widget. See the places where
//! [`Launcher::view_launcher_log`] is called, and look for a
//! `widget::vertical_slider`, then copy the code.
//!
//! The way this works is,
//! it assumes logs are a big list of lines.
//! This renders a "subslice" of this big list.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```txt
//! [info] Starting up launcher
//! [info] Installing fabric             <--|
//! - Downloading library: (1/7)            |
//! - Downloading library: (2/7)            |
//! - Downloading library: (3/7)            |
//! - Downloading library: (4/7)            |
//! - Downloading library: (5/7)         <--|
//! - Downloading library: (6/7)
//! - Downloading library: (7/7)
//! [info] Finished installing fabric
//! ```
//!
//! You can see uses of this in the following
//! (but not limited to) places:
//! - Instance log viewer
//! - Launcher debug log (the bottom bar)
//!
//! See [`Launcher::view_launcher_log`] for more info.

    /// # Arguments
    /// - `text`: A list of log lines and their type
    ///   (info/error/point)
    /// - `text_size`: The size of the log text.
    ///   Recommended: `12.0`
    /// - `scroll`: The amount of lines scrolled down.
    ///   `0` for the beginning, add 1 to it as you scroll down.
    /// - `width_reduction`, `height_reduction`: How much the other
    ///   UI elements "eat into" the log space. I'll explain this in layouting.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A tuple of:
    /// - `f64`: the total height of the log in lines
    ///   **including word wrapping, so it's not just `text.len()`**.
    ///   You can use this in your handrolled scrollbar, by representing scroll as
    ///   `(length - scroll) / length` (length is this number).
    /// - `Element`: The iced element of the log, put this in your GUI.
    ///
    /// # Layouting
    /// I made a deliberate (although questionable) design choice implementing this as
    /// "cutting-into"s of the total space, instead of a width and height of the log.
    ///
    /// This was mainly for ease of implementation and because it was ok for the use case
    /// of this log viewer. It's not exactly nice but it works.
    ///
    /// Essentially, lets say you have this GUI:
    ///
    /// ```txt
    /// + new| [info] Starting  |
    /// -----|   launcher...    |
    /// hello| [info] Installing|
    /// world|   fabric.        |

    /// the space of the log. In this terminology
    /// we assume the log is destined to occupy the
    /// entire screen but is unfortunately trespassed upon.
    ///
    /// So `width_reduction` would include the width of the
    /// sidebar, and `height_reduction` would include the
    /// height of the bottom bar.
